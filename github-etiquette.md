Keep file paths short and sensible. 
Don't use funky characters and spaces in your file names, as these cause trouble because of differences in Mac/Windows systems. 
Always pull before pushing in case someone has done any work since the last time you pulled - you don't want anyone's work to get lost or to have to resolve many coding conflicts.
